# BridgeLabz SIPP Training – Java Daily Progress

Welcome to my Java learning journey as part of the BridgeLabz SIPP Training! This repository contains all the Java programs and concepts I’ve practiced and implemented **day-wise**.

---

## 📅 Daily Breakdown

## >--->-- JAVA FUNDAMENTALS --<---<

- **Day 1** – 🧠 `PracticeProblems`  
  Basic problem-solving exercises to get started with Java syntax and logic.

- **Day 2** – 📚 `JavaFundamentals`  
  Introduction to Java basics – variables, data types, control structures.

- **Day 3** – 🔍 `CoreJava`  
  Core concepts including loops, operators, and type casting.

- **Day 4** – 🧮 `Arrays`  
  One-dimensional and multi-dimensional array handling and algorithms.

- **Day 5** – 🔤 `String`  
  Working with `String`, `StringBuilder`, and common string problems.

- **Day 6** – 🔁 `Methods`  
  Functions, method overloading, recursion, and modular Java programming.

- **Day 7** – 🧩 `Built-in_Function`  
  Using Java’s built-in classes and functions from standard libraries.
  
## >--->-- OOPS --<---<

- **Day 8** – 🧱 `ClassAndObject`  
  Starting with Object-Oriented Programming — classes and objects.

- **Day 9** – 🏗️ `JavaConstructor`  
  Worked on constructor and access modifier-based problems using real-life examples like Product, Course, Vehicle, Student, Book, Bank Account, and Employee.

- **Day 10** – 🔒 `This_Final_StaticKeyword`  
  Explored this, final, and static keywords with examples in object management.

- **Day 11** – 🧩 `ObjectModeling`  
  Modeled real-world systems using classes, objects & relationships.

- **Day 12** – 🧬 `Inheritance`  
  Practiced single, multilevel, hierarchical inheritance with real-world models like Library, Vehicle, and University.

- **Day 13** – 🔗 `Encapsulation_Polymorphism_AbstractClass_Interface`  
  Covered core OOP pillars – data hiding, polymorphic behavior, abstract design, and interface contracts.

## >--->-- DSA WITH JAVA CONCEPTS --<---<

- **Day 14** – 🔗 LinkedList
 Implementation and application of singly and doubly linked lists.

- **Day 15** – 📦 StackQueueHashMapHashFunction
 Explored data structures like Stack, Queue, HashMap, and custom hash functions.

- **Day 16** – 🔃 Sorting
Implemented and analyzed sorting algorithms like Bubble, Selection, and Heap sort.

- **Day 17** – 🔎 `Linear_Binary_Search`  
  Implemented Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms with performance comparison and input validation.

- **Day 18** – 📈 `RuntimeAnalysis_BigONotations`  
  Analyzed Java program performance using different input sizes. Explored Big-O notations, time/space trade-offs, and string concatenation vs. StringBuilder performance.
